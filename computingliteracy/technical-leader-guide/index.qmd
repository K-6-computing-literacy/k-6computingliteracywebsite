## What is the Computing Outreach Program?

Computing outreach involves engaging K-12 students in regular, hands-on computing activities to foster interest and competency in computational skills. This includes introducing students to computational thinking and problem-solving through events, workshops, classroom activities, and using technologies. The goal is to provide consistent exposure to the computing field in a fun and engaging way.

## What to Expect as a Computing Outreach Fellow

* You will be tasked with activities that will vary depending on the grades you are working with.
* All activities will be held in groups that can vary depending on the size of the class.
* Working with younger students (K to 2nd grade) will involve activities that are more focused on reading and explaining methods of computational thinking.
* Older students (5th to 6th grade) will involve the use of robotics in activities, requiring fellows to understand how the robots work and how they fit into the activities.
* You will be given outlines that will guide you through the necessary steps for conducting activities.

## Helping Middle School Students

Middle school students (grades 6-8) are at a critical stage where they can begin to explore more advanced computational concepts. As a fellow, you will:

* Introduce students to programming concepts using beginner-friendly languages like Python.
* Facilitate hands-on activities that involve building and programming robots or creating simple games.
* Encourage teamwork and collaboration through group projects that solve real-world problems using computational thinking.
* Provide guidance on how computing skills can be applied in various fields, such as science, art, and engineering.

## Helping High School Students

High school students (grades 9-12) are ready to dive deeper into computing and explore career opportunities in the field. As a fellow, you will:

* Teach students more advanced programming concepts, such as algorithms, data structures, and web development.
* Guide students in creating their own projects, such as websites, apps, or robotics projects.
* Organize workshops to encourage creativity and problem-solving.
* Discuss career paths in computing, including software development, data science, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.
* Provide mentorship and resources for students interested in pursuing computing-related college programs or certifications.

## Key Responsibilities

* Working with children and teenagers across different age groups.
* Collaborating with faculty at Meadville public schools.
* Running through and understanding activities beforehand.
* Reading books and using resources that improve students' understanding of computational skills.
* Adapting activities to suit the age group and skill level of the students.
