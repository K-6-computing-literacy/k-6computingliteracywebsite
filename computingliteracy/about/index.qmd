## Our Mission and Goal

Our goal is to foster an ongoing collaboration between the Department of Computer and Information Science at Allegheny College and Crawford Central elementary schools. This initiative introduces K-6 students to computing concepts, ensuring consistent exposure to STEM from early education.

## Pennsylvania Education Framework

### STEM in Pennsylvania

STEM education in Pennsylvania emphasizes literacy for all students, reflection, iteration, community integration, and partnerships between educators, families, and institutions.

### Computer Science Literacy

The current Pennsylvania framework prioritizes grades 7-12, but we aim to bridge this gap by introducing computer science concepts to younger students, aligned with state standards.
