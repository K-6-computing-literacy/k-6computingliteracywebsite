## Description

In this activity, students will learn about the importance of creating strong passwords to protect their online accounts. Through interactive games and discussions, students will understand the concept of a strong password, learn why weak passwords can be easily guessed, and practice creating secure passwords using a mix of characters. This hands-on activity helps introduce cybersecurity concepts and promotes safe online behavior.

## Time Required

- **Estimated Time**: 1 Hour

## Materials Required

- IPADs
- Whiteboard or digital presentation for demonstrating concepts
- Paper and pencils for password creation practice
- Printouts or projector for displaying examples of strong and weak passwords
- [Online password strength meter](https://www.passwordmonster.com/)

## Steps to Conduct the Activity

### Set-Up

- Divide the students into small groups.
- Hand each group a piece of paper and a pencil to use later in the activity.

### Difficulty Breakdown

#### Introduction

- Start by asking students what passwords are and why they are used. 
- Explain that passwords help protect personal information from being accessed by others online.
- Discuss the importance of using passwords that are hard to guess, and introduce the term “strong password.”
- Write examples of weak passwords on the board (e.g., `123456`, `password`, `abc123`) and explain why these are easy to guess.
- Discuss what makes a strong password, including:
    - A mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
    - Numbers
    - Symbols (e.g., `@`, `#`, `$`, etc.)
    - Avoiding common words or personal information (like names and birthdays)

#### Instructions

- Challenge each group to come up with a easy password and a strong password following the rules discussed.
- Give them a reason to come up with this idea (Like a treasure password).
- Once groups have created their passwords, have them test their passwords using an online password strength meter 
- Then have a game play out where different group guess each of their passwords to see if it is easy to guess the passwords.
- Discuss how to keep passwords safe:
    - Don’t share passwords with others.
    - Use different passwords for different websites.
    - Change passwords regularly.
    - Use a password manager.

## Discussion & Reflection

After the activity has been completed, gather the class for a quick debrief. We can ask:

- Why is it important to use strong passwords?
- How can you protect yourself online?
- Let them share their own tips for staying safe online.

## Wrap-Up

This activity aims to enhance students' understanding of internet safety by actively engaging them in identifying safe and unsafe  passwords. By allowing students to make and guess each others' passwords, students apply their knowledge in a practical and interactive manner, reinforcing internet safety practices.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should:

- Understand the importance of strong passwords in cybersecurity.
- Learn how to create secure passwords using a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Recognize the risks of using weak passwords and sharing them with others.
- Gain confidence in protecting their personal information online.
