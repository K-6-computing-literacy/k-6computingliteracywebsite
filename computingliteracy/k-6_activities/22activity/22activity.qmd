## Description

In this activity, students will practice training AI by identifying different objects as either fish or trash. Students will watch a video and complete a short lesson module on how to train AI to look for certain parameters.

## Time Required

- **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

## Materials Required

- IPADs
- [Code.org Video](https://youtu.be/KHbwOetbmbs)
- [Code.org Lesson Module](https://studio.code.org/courses/oceans/units/1/lessons/1/levels/2)


## Steps to Conduct the Activity

### Difficulty Breakdown

#### Introduction

- Discuss with students about what they think AI and machine learning are.
- Have the students watch the video about AI and machine learning. 
- Split students into small groups. If there are enough IPADs, students may work individually.

#### Beginner

- Have students complete module lessons 2-4 on the IPADs. 
- üîç *Focus Skills*: machine learning, data analysis, patience

#### Intermediate

- Have students complete module lessons 2-4 on the IPADs. 
- Have students complete module lessons 6 and 8 on the IPADs.
- üîç *Focus Skills*: machine learning, data analysis & interpretation, patience

## Discussion & Reflection

After the activity has been completed, gather the class for a quick debrief. We can ask:

- How does AI know how to identify objects?
- Does the AI do a better job with more or less training?
- Did your AI have any trouble correctly identifying the fish?

## Wrap-Up

This activity aims to enhance students' understanding of machine learning and AI pattern recognition. By training AI, students apply their knowledge in a practical and interactive manner, reinforcing the time and effort that goes into machine learning.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should be able to:

- Understand what AI and machine learning are
- Understand how one trains AI
- Explain how more training leads to more accurate training results
