## Description

Students program a BeeBot robot to collect "garbage" from different locations on a map using directional buttons. This hands-on activity teaches **sequencing**, **manual control**, and how computers follow step-by-step commands in order.

## Time Required

- **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

## Materials Required

- **BeeBot robots** (1 per group of 2-3 students)
- **BeeBot garbage collection attachment** (small basket or container that attaches to the top)
- **Map/Grid mat** (can be printed or drawn on poster board - 4x4 or 5x5 grid)
- **"Garbage" items** (small plastic pieces, pom-poms, blocks, or printed paper trash)
- **Starting point marker** (green square or sticker)
- **"Trash can" marker** (blue square or recycling bin image)
- Optional: Colored tape to create grid lines on the floor

## About BeeBot Robots

BeeBot is a bee-shaped robot with directional buttons: Forward (⬆️), Backward (⬇️), Left (⬅️), Right (➡️), Go (green), and Clear (X). It remembers up to 40 commands in sequence.

## Connection to Computing

This activity teaches: **Sequencing** (order matters), **Algorithms** (step-by-step plans), **Debugging** (testing and fixing), **Manual Control** (programming each movement), and **Input/Output** (button presses create actions) - the same concepts used in computers, tablets, and video games.

## Map Setup

Place a green START square, 3-5 "garbage" pieces, and a blue TRASH CAN square at different locations on the map.

## Steps to Conduct the Activity

### Set-Up

Divide students into groups of 2-3. Give each group a BeeBot with garbage attachment and a map with 3 garbage pieces. Demonstrate the buttons and how BeeBot remembers commands in order (like a recipe). Show example: Forward, Forward, Go → moves 2 spaces.

### Difficulty Breakdown

#### Beginner (Kindergarten)

**Challenge 1:** Collect one piece 2-3 spaces away. Plan, press buttons, test, and debug if needed.  
**Challenge 2:** Collect garbage and return to trash can. Practice reverse planning.  
**Challenge 3:** Collect 2-3 pieces one by one, breaking the problem into smaller steps.  
🔍 *Focus Skills*: counting, sequencing, trial and error

#### Intermediate (1st Grade)

**Challenge 1:** Collect 3 pieces using the FEWEST button presses. Draw route first, then test.  
**Challenge 2:** Add obstacles between START and garbage. Plan around them using turns.  
**Challenge 3:** Team race - who can collect all garbage first? Discuss planning vs. rushing.  
🔍 *Focus Skills*: optimization, spatial reasoning, strategic thinking

## Discussion & Reflection

Gather students for discussion:

- What happened when BeeBot didn't go where you wanted? How did you fix it?
- What was the hardest/most fun part?
- How is BeeBot like a computer? What else follows step-by-step instructions?
- Why is order important when giving commands?

## Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

- Use directional commands to control BeeBot
- Create and test command sequences
- Understand that order matters in programming
- Debug by testing and fixing errors
- Plan movement across a grid
- Work collaboratively to solve problems
