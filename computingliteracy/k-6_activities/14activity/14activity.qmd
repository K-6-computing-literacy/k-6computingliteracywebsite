## Description

In this activity, students will use a robot to create squares made up of forward movements and left or right turns. After students progress through the sqaure challenge, they will attempt more complex challenges of driving the robot from one point to another starting from various points. This approach fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills while enhancing their understanding of the relationship between input and output in programming.

## Time Required

- **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

## Materials Required

- Programmable and driveable robot 
- IPAD
- Map
- Square Challenge Paper Instructions

## Steps to Conduct the Activity

### Set-Up

- Divide students into small groups. Have them spread out throughout the room, ensuring each group has room to run the activity.
- Each group should recieve a map, an IPAD, a robot, and at least one copy of the paper instructions.

### Difficulty Breakdown

#### Beginner
- Students should be familiar with the robot application, which uses code blocks or buttons to control movement. To refresh their awareness and with the help of the instruction paper, have them attempt to move the robot in two square rotations. Make one with only forward and left movements, and one with only forward and right movements.
- Once the sqaure challenge has been completed, set up the map to resemble the A-to-B generated by the IPAD. Have the students use the ipad directions to traverse the bot using different direction cobinations.
- Encourage students to complete the course independently and assist those who are confused or struggling with the task.
- Once a student finishes their pathway, have them reposition the Blue Bot as designated by the ipad's new pathway.
- üîç *Focus Skills*: critical thinking, input and output relationships

- Encourage students to complete the course independently and assist those who are confused or struggling with the task.
- Once a student finishes their pathway, have them reposition the Blue Bot as designated by the ipad's new pathway.
- After meeting their marked goals twice, allow them to modify the A-to-B pathways and provide guidance if their courses are not conditionally possible. 
- Once modifying their courses, ask them to keep track of how many times they meet their goal.
- üîç *Focus Skills*: critical thinking, input and output relationships

## Discussion & Reflection

After the activity has been completed, gather the class for a quick debrief. We can ask:

- How many of you were able to complete the squares?
- Did you have any troubles? Where?
- What directional combinations were tricky and why?
- Were there any pathways you found to be easy?
- How many times were you able to finish your A-to-B pathways?
- For those who kept count, how many times were you able to complete the pathway?
   
## Wrap-Up

By programming Blue-Bots to navigate maps with specific constraints, students develop an understanding of how conditions affect movement and decision-making. The activity reinforces computational thinking, logical reasoning, and teamwork while encouraging students to experiment with different coding sequences.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should be able to:

- Understand basic coding principles.
- Enhance their computational thinking skills by breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable conditions and actions.
- Test their block code in a practical setup and debug any issues that arise to ensure the robot navigates correctly.
