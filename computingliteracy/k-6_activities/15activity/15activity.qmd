## Description

Students will be introduced to the basics of electronics using Arduino, an open-source microcontroller. They will learn to control the flow of current through LEDs, programming them to turn on and off at specified intervals. This hands-on experience with Arduino will provide them with a foundational understanding of how electronic circuits and programming interact.

## Materials required

- Arduino Instructions: [Intro to Basic Electronics with Arduino](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cPh0NCV_lXEYbUFzkZiseoTPQTM8filLLZxizIvs-Q4/edit#heading=h.h1avinm0cmy6)
- Arduino Board and program
- Arduino USB connector cable
- 3 LEDs
- 3 1k ohm resistor
- Connecting Wire

## Steps to conduct the activity

### Step 1: Accessesing Arduino Instructions

- Acssess insturction in order to run activity [Intro to Basic Electronics with Arduino](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cPh0NCV_lXEYbUFzkZiseoTPQTM8filLLZxizIvs-Q4/edit#heading=h.h1avinm0cmy6)

## Reflection

- Pause at the 50-minute mark to discuss progress and challenges 
- Ask students to describe what they observed from trying to get the LEDs to light up 
- Relate the activity to everday use of certain electironic that work with simalr electonics like LED lights. 


## Learning Outcomes

- Introducing students to the fundamentals of electronics equips them with a deeper understanding of how we interact with and manipulate electronic devices. By gaining this foundational knowledge, they can comprehend the essential processes and steps required to make electronic components function effectively. This early exposure not only explains the workings of everyday technology but also fosters curiosity and encourages hands-on experimentation.
