## Description

In this activity, students will use generative AI to create backgrounds for their dance party. Students will watch a video and complete a short lesson module on generative AI.

## Time Required

- **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

## Materials Required

- IPADs
- [Code.org Video](https://youtu.be/m4fcHdJ-65o)
- [Code.org Lesson Module](https://studio.code.org/courses/dance-ai-2023/units/1/lessons/1/levels/2)

## Steps to Conduct the Activity

### Difficulty Breakdown

#### Introduction

- Discuss with students about what they think AI is. Can it be used to generate things?
- Have the students watch the video about AI.
- Split students into small groups. If there are enough IPADs, students may work individually.

#### Instructions

- Have students complete all of the module lessons on the IPADs, making sure they watch the videos as they go.
- üîç *Focus Skills*: object generation, creativity

## Discussion & Reflection

After the activity has been completed, gather the class for a quick debrief. We can ask:

- Can AI be used to generate objects? What about regeneration?

## Wrap-Up

This activity aims to enhance students' understanding of AI media generation. By using the AI 'generate effect' code block, students apply their knowledge in a practical and interactive manner, building understanding of AI while fostering creativity.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should be able to:

- Identify if AI can generate media
- Identify if AI can rengenerate media using the same prompt
- Briefly explain how AI works
