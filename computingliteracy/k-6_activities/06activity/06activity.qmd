## Description

In this activity, students will identify, analyze, and create simple patterns using shapes, colors, or numbers. The activity is designed with increasing difficulty based on previous coding experience, allowing students to build their programming logic as they play.

## Time Required

- **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

## Materials Needed

- [Pattern Flashcards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V3JFvTcGnzuxr5h--GWg7XKLVxvFlaQkc-AeubvxrNM/edit?tab=t.0)
- Something to write with
- IPADs preset to [Pattern Coding Activity](https://blockly.games/)

##  Steps to Conduct the Activity

### Set-Up

- As a group, introduce the idea of patterns and walk through an example.
- Split students into small groups. Have them spread out throughout the room, ensuring each group has enough room to run the activity.
- Each group should recieve one set of flashcards, and a writing utensil. IPADs will be passed out later in the activity.

### Difficulty Breakdown

#### Instructions

- Provide students with sets of simple sequences and ask them to identify the pattern
  - Examples:
    - Shapes: `🔺🔺⚫️🔺🔺⚫️…`
    - Colors: `🟡🟡🟠🟡🟡🟠…`
    - Numbers: `3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6…`
- Once students can identify the pattern, challenge them to continue the sequence by adding the next few elements.
  - Example: Sequence: `🔵🔵🟢🔵🔵🟢…` (They add 🔵🔵🟢 next)
- Once all students have completed the majority of the pattern flashcards, direct their
attention to their IPADs. Collect the flashcards while they are getting set up.
- Have students work on the modules titled "Puzzle" and "Maze" until the end of the class period.
- 🔍 *Focus Skills*: critical thinking, problem-solving, pattern recognition

## Discussion & Reflection

After the activity has been completed, gather the class for a quick debrief. We can:

- Were there any pattern flashcards that were tricky to solve?
- Were there any coded pattern activities that were tricky to solve?
- Which ones, and why?

## Wrap-Up

Participating in this activity will enhance students' critical thinking. By progressively increasing the difficulty of patterns, students will utilize problem-solving principles and improve their recognition skills.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should be able to:

- Recognize and extend patterns.
- Students will enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
- Create their own patterns and communicate them effectively.
