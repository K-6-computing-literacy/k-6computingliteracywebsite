## Description

In this activity, students will learn about sorting methods by arranging numbered paper strips in order using the different approaches a computer can take. 

## Time Required

- **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

## Materials Required

- Paper pieces labelled 1-10
- Notebook & pen

## Steps to Conduct the Activity

### The Sorting Methods

#### Bubble Sorting
Takes two adjacent pieces and compares them together, arranging them by swapping if they are in the wrong order.

Set-Up:
- Lay out the numbered paper strips in a random order.
- Compare each pair of adjacent strips and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
- Repeat this process until the strips are sorted.

#### Selection Sorting
Repeatedly finds the smallest item in the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.

Set-Up:
- Lay out the numbered paper strips in a random order.
- Find the smallest number among all the strips and move it to the first position.
- Find the next smallest number from the remaining strips and place it next to the first.
- Repeat until all strips are sorted.

#### Insertion Sorting
Involves sorting one item at a time by comparing each new item with the items already sorted and inserting it in the correct position.

Set-Up:
- Lay out the numbered paper strips in a random order.
- Start with the second strip and compare it to the first. Insert it in the correct position (before or after the first strip).
- Take the third strip and compare it to the already sorted strips, inserting it in the correct position.
- Repeat the process until all strips are sorted.

### Difficulty Breakdown

#### Introduction
- Interact with students and ask why they think having things sorted and arranged can be useful.
- Explain the three different sorting methods we will be using: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

#### Beginner
- Only use the paper strips labeled 1-5.
- Run through each of the sorting methods at least once.
- üîç *Focus Skills*: computational thinking, problem-solving

#### Intermediate
- Use all paper strips.
- Run through each of the sorting methods at least once.
- üîç *Focus Skills*: computational thinking, problem-solving

## Discussion & Reflection

After the activity has been completed, gather the class for a quick debrief. We can ask:

- Which method took them the least amount of time to complete?
- If the answers vary, ask them why they felt that way.

### Answers on Which Algorithm is Usually Faster

- **Bubble Sort**: Slow because it has to compare and swap a lot.
- **Selection Sort**: A little better than bubble sort but still has to make many comparisons.
- **Insertion Sort**: Often the fastest of the three for small lists because it finds the right spot for each item without many unnecessary moves.

## Wrap-Up

Participating in this activity will enhance students' computational thinking. The added visual and hands-on application of the paper slips will help students undertsand the concepts of sorting and improve their understanding of coding efficiency.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should:

- Understand the basic concepts of sorting and why it is useful.
- Learn how to perform Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- Recognize the differences in efficiency between the three sorting methods.
