## Description

In this activity, students will train AI to recognize text and respond. Students will watch a video and complete a short lesson module on how to train AI to look for certain parameters.

## Time Required

- **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

## Materials Required

- IPADs or Shared Projector
- [Teacher Lesson Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LdfizJ9nQJprYBBkPh7KBo-lBKjDuQcwg6MJLdkESlY/edit?tab=t.0)
- [Lesson Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Og472tGr2w28jY-p2jO3JQjspAjJYIqVtgALitZN0Go/edit?tab=t.0)


## Steps to Conduct the Activity

### Difficulty Breakdown

#### Set-Up

- On the chosen techology device, follow steps 1-22.
- Have all the students watch a quick demo on how the different phrases cause the face to react.

#### Beginner

- Keep all the students in one large group.
- Run through steps 23-39.
- üîç *Focus Skills*: group collaboration, sentimental analysis

#### Intermediate

- Break the students down into small groups.
- Have students run through steps 23-39 in their groups.
- üîç *Focus Skills*: teamwork, sentimental analysis

## Discussion & Reflection

After the activity has been completed, gather the class for a quick debrief. We can ask:

- Was your AI able to recognize compliments and insults?
- Could you train the machine to recognize other types of messages?
- Can you think of examples where it would be important to train a computer to recognize emotion in writing?

## Wrap-Up

This activity aims to enhance students' understanding of machine learning and AI pattern recognition. By training AI, students apply their knowledge in a practical and interactive manner, reinforcing the time and effort that goes into machine learning.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should be able to:

- Train a computer to recognize emotional tone through text
- Explain how more training leads to more accurate training results
