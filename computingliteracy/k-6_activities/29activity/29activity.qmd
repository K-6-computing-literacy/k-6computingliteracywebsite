## Description

In this activity, students will learn about different camera angles in video games and how it changes the way a player intrepets a situation. Students will look at a few examples and explain how they feel before testing their knowledge on the different camera POVs.

## Time Required

- **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

## Materials Required

- Shared Projector  (to show a few example pictures)
- IPADs
- [Kahoot Assessment](TBD)
- [POV Explanation Reference](https://medium.com/@staskas/how-does-camera-perspective-affect-player-experience-and-feelings-b187e6824f7c)  *{Optional}*

## Steps to Conduct the Activity

### Difficulty Breakdown

#### Introduction

- Introduce to the students that games have different ways they present. Allow the students to give example games and if they know what perspective they play the game through.
- Dive deeper into each of the above perspectives, allowing the students to guess what POV that is. Ask the students to divulge how each of these perspectives make them feel

#### Instructions

- Split the students into small groups and pass out the pre set up IPADs. Students may work individually if there are enough IPADs.
- Run through the Kahoot with the students. 
- üîç *Focus Skills*: listening, game mechanics

## Discussion & Reflection

After the activity has been completed, gather the class for a quick debrief. We can ask:

- What is an example of a game camera POV?
- How does a different POV change a game?

## Wrap-Up

This activity aims to enhance students' understanding of character POVs in game design. By talking through examples and taking a Kahoot quiz, students apply their knowledge in a practical and interactive manner, reinforcing their understanding of character movement.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should be able to:

- Identify at least two types of POV
- Explain how these two types differ to the game design and as a user
