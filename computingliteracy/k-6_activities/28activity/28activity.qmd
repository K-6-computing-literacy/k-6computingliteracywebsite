## Description

In this activity, students will learn about different styles of character movements in a video game. Students will watch two short examples, before learning how to code a simple WASD and Jump movement style using Scratch.

## Time Required

- **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

## Materials Required

- Shared Projector
- [Movement Style Ex. #1](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/702435254/)
- [Movement Style Ex. #2](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/492578456/)
- [Scratch.org's Create](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted)
- IPADs

## WASD and Jump Code Template

## Steps to Conduct the Activity

### Difficulty Breakdown

#### Introduction

- Introduce to the students that there are different game movement styles. Allow the students to give examples, such as only forward, WASD, jumping, etc. Show the students the examples.
- Split the students into small groups and pass out the pre set up IPADs. Students may work individually if there are enough IPADs.

#### Beginner

- Guide the students through building the code featured above, focusing solely on the WASD movements.
- Allow the students to guess what comes next while building the code.
- üîç *Focus Skills*: instruction following, block coding, character movements

#### Intermediate

- Guide the students through building the WASD code above.
- Allow the students to guess what comes next while building the code.
- Introduce the Jump portion of the code. Given what has already been built, what do we probably need for this section?
- Guide students through the remainder of the code.
- üîç *Focus Skills*: instruction following, block coding, character movements

## Discussion & Reflection

After the activity has been completed, gather the class for a quick debrief. We can ask:

- What are some different ways video game characters can move?
- Why is it important to test our code as we work?

## Wrap-Up

This activity aims to enhance students' understanding of character movement in game design. By collectively coding an example movement style, students apply their knowledge in a practical and interactive manner, reinforcing their understanding of character movement.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should be able to:

- Give an example of character movement style
- Explain the process we used to code our movement
- Explain why you test/debug code in stages, rather than all at once
