## Steps to Conduct the Activity

### Difficulty Breakdown

#### Introduction

- Introduce to the students that characters have different things that make them realistic. Allow the students to give examples, such as outfits, physical design, personality, color pallete, etc.
- Show students the example pictures. Is this a "good guy" or a "bad guy"? Why?
- Pass out copies of the "Things to Include" sheet and explain that the students will now make their own character. Using the sheet as a reference, explain to the students that they should create a school-appropiate character that they will present to the group. We will then try to guess whether their character is "good" or "bad".
- Pass out the blank paper and drawing supplies.

#### Instructions

- Give the students time to draw their characters. Walk around and help as needed.
- After 15-20 minutes, regroup the students.
- One by one, allow the students to present their character and have the group guess if it's a "good guy" or a "bad guy".
- üîç *Focus Skills*: creativity, design characteristics, visual communication

## Discussion & Reflection

After the activity has been completed, gather the class for a quick debrief. We can ask:

- Did we have any common outfit themes for our characters? Color schemes?
- What makes a "bad" or "good" guy? Is this interpretation different for everyone?

## Wrap-Up

This activity aims to enhance students' understanding of character design and how different elements work together to make a character realistic. By creating and sharing their characters, students apply their knowledge in a practical and interactive manner, reinforcing their understanding of character design and interpretation.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should be able to:

- Understand that character designs are important to building a character
- Interpret design choices within given context
