- Run through the Lesson Slides Pt.2 with the class.
About halfway through, the worksheet should be passed out. Completing it is worked in to the slides.
- üîç *Focus Skills*: bias understanding, bias reduction, AI literacy

## Discussion & Reflection

After the activity has been completed, gather the class for a quick debrief. We can ask:

- How does AI become biased?
- How does this bias affect you? How might it affect your peers?

## Wrap-Up

This activity aims to enhance students' understanding of AI and potential bias when training it. By looking through examples, students apply their knowledge in a practical and interactive manner, reinforcing their understanding of AI bias.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should be able to:

- Define AI bias
- Understand how AI bias occurs
- Understand how to help reduce AI bias
