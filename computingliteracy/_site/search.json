A circuit is like a trail and the negative needs to be able to walk back to the battery through the postive.\nDemonstrate the creation of a playdoh light system. Start by creating two blobs of playdough connect the red end of the battery to one and the black end to the other blob. Explain that the light has a long leg and a short leg. The short leg always has to be on the negative (black) side and the long leg always has to be towards the postive (red) side. Then connect the light to the blobs. Explain that the blobs can not touch out the electricity will skip past the light and not turn it on (this is called a short circuit). After connecting the light correctly the light should turn on. Explain if the light does not turn on when they try the first thing to test is to switch the direction of the legs (this is the most common mistake).\n\n\n\n\nLED_pins\n\n\n\n\n\nsingle_circuit\n\n\n\nShow the students it is possible to connect two lights by creating 3 blobs of playdoh and the outer blobs should be the postivie and negative ends connected to the play dough. Then use a light to connect the blobs with the long leg always facing the postive side. This is a series circuit.\n\n\n\n\nseries_circuit\n\n\n\nShow the students it is possible to connect more than one light in the same section. Connect a second LED in the same direction as the one next to it. This is called a parallel circuit.\n\n\n\n\nparellel_circuit\n\n\n\nNon-conductive clay can be used to block current and connect the creations. Try not to mix the play doh with the clay.\nNow give each of the students their materials to make their own. Here are some example challengegs to give them to try\n\nCan you follow the path that electricity takes to light up starting with the black wire?\nCan you get all the different colors to light up?\nCan you get more than 3 blobs of playdoh connected in a circuit?\n\nAn alternative method of this activity is using an arduino. Set up an Arduino with the following blink code using the Arduino IDE changing the pin 13 to whatever pin/s you plan to use. The Arduino IDE can be used on any laptop. An Arduino can run more than one playdoh circuit at a time by adding more pins. You can also try to add the pins to light up at different times to create a christmas light display. Make sure the black wire is connected to the GND on the Ardunio and the red wire is connected to the digital pin number.\n\n\n\n\narduino_blink\n\n\n\n\n\narduino_pins\n\n\nvoid setup() {\n  // put your setup code here, to run once:\n  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:\n  digitalWrite(13, LOW);\n  delay(1000);\n  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); \n}"

Insert it in the correct position (before or after the first strip).\nTake the third strip and compare it to the already sorted strips, inserting it in the correct position.\nRepeat the process until all strips are sorted.\n\nReference video to be played before activity: Insertion Sort Algorithm"

You can also introduce variations such as color patterns or number patterns.\nGive the students a few different sequences to practice with, reinforcing how to spot and predict the next part of a pattern.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Creating Their Own Patterns\n\nEncourage students to mix and match the shape cutouts to create their own patterns on the paper or whiteboard.\nAs they work, ask them to think about how their patterns work—whether they repeat, alternate, or grow.\nAllow the students to share their patterns with the class and ask their peers to guess how the patterns work.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Peer Challenge Game\n\nOnce each student has created their pattern, let them challenge their peers to identify the pattern they made.\nStudents will take turns presenting their patterns to the group, while the rest of the class tries to figure out how the pattern works.

You may have to push the wires in further ro reach properly.\n\n\n\n\nSolder Connector\n\n\n\n\n\nSolder Connector\n\n\n\nUse the heat gun about 3 inches away from the wire to very carefully to shrink the connector ON A HEAT SAFE SURFACE - the regular wood of the table will burn so use a piece of scrap wood. Wait until the solder in the middle has melted to stop heating it. Don’t touch it with your fingers until it has cooled. Try your best not to melt the wires themselves and if you see that happening turn off the heat gun and ask for help.\n\n\n\n\nHeat Gun\n\n\n\n\n\nHeat Gun\n\n\n\nWait till it has cooled and check that the wires are secure in the connector and don’t move when you lightly tug on them.\nNow on the same end of the white wire take the side you did not mark and connect it to the red wire.

Pre-Check\n\nEnsure the battery is charged.\nVerify all solder connections are sealed and not loose.\nTug gently on each connection to make sure it is secure.\nConfirm the motor system is waterproofed and wires are zip-tied out of the way.\n\n\n\n2. Power On\n\nInsert the 9V battery into the holder.\nFlip the main power switch ON.\nConfirm switches are in the OFF (middle) position before starting tests.\n\n\n\n3. Dry Testing (Optional)\n\nHold the ROV above a surface and flip each switch to test motor direction.\nEnsure both motors respond and spin freely.\nWatch for any rubbing, tangle, or obstruction issues.\n\n\n\n4. Pool Testing\n\nCarefully place the ROV into the small pool or bin of water.\nObserve how it floats—adjust weights if it tips or leans.\nFlip the first switch and test forward/backward motor response.\nFlip the second switch to test vertical (up/down) motor control.\nTry brief combinations of both motors.\nWatch for:\n\nDelayed or missing motor response\nWater intrusion (bubbles or shorts)\nTangled or dragging wires\n\nIf needed, remove the ROV, dry off, and perform fixes before testing again.\n\n\nExtra Pool Activities\n\nTest buoyancy - add weights as needed to have neutral buoyancy where it does not float to the top by itself or sink (ideal for ROVs)\nHave an ROV\nMake a mini obstacle course using pool noodles\n\n\n\n\n5. Troubleshooting\n\nIf a motor does not spin:\n\nCheck soldered connections.\nConfirm correct wire colors and direction.\nSwap leads to reverse spin if needed.\nCheck for shorts or loosened wires due to water.\n\nAsk for help from an instructor if you’re stuck.\n\n\n\n6. Safety Checks\n\nKeep fingers, hair, and clothing away from spinning propellers.\nDo not touch active wires with wet hands.\nImmediately report any smoking, sparking, or overheating parts."

These skills are relevant across all disciplines and vital for civic engagement, workforce development, and lifelong learning.\n\nElementary students begin exploring basic logic, teamwork, and creative problem-solving.\nMiddle school students expand into physical computing, data collection, and iterative design.\nHigh school students take on more complex projects, including robotics, control systems, and ethical use of technology.\n\nBy offering a continuous path through K–12, we support long-term engagement and academic growth in STEM fields."
