How far? How fast?”\n\nShow a SPECIFIC block code example:\n\n“Move forward 30 cm at 50% speed”\nAsk: “Now what will happen? Is this clearer?”\n\nExplain: Just like giving instructions to AI, giving instructions to robots requires clarity and detail!\n\n\n\nPart 2: Vague Instructions Challenge (15 minutes)\nStudents work in roles within their group:\n\nRole 1 - Coder: One student creates a short program (3-5 blocks) with intentionally vague or minimal instructions\n\nExamples:\n\n“Move” without direction or distance\n“Turn” without specifying degrees\n“Make sound” without choosing which sound\n\n\nRole 2 - Predictor: Another student predicts what the robot will do without seeing the code details\nRole 3 - Observer: The group runs the program and observes: “What happened? Was it predictable? What was unclear?”\nDiscuss together: Why did the vague instructions cause confusion or unexpected results?\nRotate roles and repeat so each student experiences being the coder\n\n\n\nPart 3: Specific Instructions Challenge (20 minutes)\nStudents take turns creating specific code:\n\nTeacher assigns a simple task: “Make Dash draw a square path on the floor”\nRole 1 - Lead Coder: One student creates SPECIFIC block code with:\n\nExact distances (e.g., “Move forward 40 cm”)\nExact angles (e.g., “Turn right 90 degrees”)\nSpeeds and durations\n\nRole 2 - Code Reviewer: Another student checks the code before running - “Is everything specific? What might go wrong?”\nRole 3 - Tester: Student runs the program and measures success\nGroup discussion: Did the robot complete the square? What needs adjustment?\nGroups refine their programs together, then rotate roles and try a new shape (triangle, rectangle, or letter)\n\n\n\nPart 4: Prompt Writing Challenge (5 minutes)\nGroups practice giving verbal “prompts”:\n\nRole 1 - Prompt Writer: One student creates a verbal task description without using their hands or pointing (e.g., “Make Dash drive in a triangle” or “Make Dash spin twice and beep”)\nRole 2 - Coder: Another student tries to code the task using ONLY the verbal description\nRole 3 - Evaluator: Third student judges if the prompt was clear enough - what details were missing?\nGroup reflection: Compare the final robot behavior to what the prompt writer intended. How could the prompt be more specific?\nTeacher selects 2-3 groups to share their best “specific prompt” examples with the class"

Today’s activity demonstrated that whether you’re coding a robot or prompting an AI, the principle is the same: specificity and clarity lead to better results.\nBy experiencing firsthand how vague block code produces unpredictable robot behavior while specific code produces consistent results, students develop an intuitive understanding of prompt engineering. This hands-on approach connects abstract AI concepts to tangible robot actions, making the importance of detailed instructions immediately visible and memorable.\nThese skills translate directly to using AI tools: a vague prompt like “tell me about animals” produces generic results, while a specific prompt like “list 5 endangered ocean animals and explain why each is endangered” produces focused, useful information. The computational thinking students practice today—breaking down tasks, specifying parameters, and iterating on instructions—prepares them for future careers in technology, AI development, and beyond."

The short leg always has to be on the negative (black) side and the long leg always has to be towards the postive (red) side. Then connect the light to the blobs.\nExplain that the blobs can not touch out the electricity will skip past the light and not turn it on (this is called a short circuit).\nAfter connecting the light correctly the light should turn on. Explain if the light does not turn on when they try the first thing to test is to switch the direction of the legs (this is the most common mistake).\n\n\n\n\n\nLED_pins\n\n\n\n\n\nsingle_circuit\n\n\n\nShow the students it is possible to connect two lights by creating 3 blobs of playdoh and the outer blobs should be the postivie and negative ends connected to the play dough.

This is a series circuit.\n\n\n\n\nseries_circuit\n\n\n\nShow the students it is possible to connect more than one light in the same section. Connect a second LED in the same direction as the one next to it.

Being specific helps technology understand exactly what you want!"
