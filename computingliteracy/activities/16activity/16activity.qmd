## Description

In this activity, students will learn about the importance of creating strong passwords to protect their online accounts. Through interactive games and discussions, students will understand the concept of a strong password, learn why weak passwords can be easily guessed, and practice creating secure passwords using a mix of characters. This hands-on activity helps introduce cybersecurity concepts and promotes safe online behavior.


## Materials Required

- Whiteboard or digital presentation for demonstrating concepts
- Paper and pencils for password creation practice
- Printouts or projector for displaying examples of strong and weak passwords
- [Online password strength meter](https://www.passwordmonster.com/)


## Steps to Conduct the Activity

### Step 1: Introduction to Passwords

- Start by asking students what passwords are and why they are used. 
- Explain that passwords help protect personal information from being accessed by others online.
- Discuss the importance of using passwords that are hard to guess, and introduce the term “strong password.”

### Step 2: What Makes a Strong Password?

- Write examples of weak passwords on the board (e.g., `123456`, `password`, `abc123`) and explain why these are easy to guess.
- Discuss what makes a strong password, including:
    - A mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
    - Numbers
    - Symbols (e.g., `@`, `#`, `$`, etc.)
    - Avoiding common words or personal information (like names and birthdays)

### Step 3: Password Creation Game

- Divide the students into small groups.
- Challenge each group to come up with a easy password and a strong password following the rules discussed.
- Give them a reason to come up with this idea (Like a treasure password).
- Once groups have created their passwords, have them test their passwords using an online password strength meter 
- Then have a game play out where different group guess each of their passwords to see if it is easy to guess the passwords.

### Step 4: Password Protection Tips

- Discuss how to keep passwords safe:
    - Don’t share passwords with others.
    - Use different passwords for different websites.
    - Change passwords regularly.
    - Use a password manager.

### Step 5: Reflection and Wrap-Up

- Ask students why it’s important to use strong passwords and how they can protect themselves online.
- Let them share their own tips for staying safe online.


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should:

- Understand the importance of strong passwords in cybersecurity.
- Learn how to create secure passwords using a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Recognize the risks of using weak passwords and sharing them with others.
- Gain confidence in protecting their personal information online.
