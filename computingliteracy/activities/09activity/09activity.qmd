## **Description**

This activity introduces students to computational thinking by guiding a "robot" through a maze using basic commands. It helps students develop skills in problem-solving, pattern recognition, and algorithmic thinking.

## **Materials Required**

- A printed or drawn maze on paper
- A small car figure or token
- A set of command cards (e.g., move forward, turn left, turn right)

## Activity Steps

### **Introduction**

- Explain the concept of computational thinking, which involves breaking down problems into manageable steps, recognizing patterns, and creating algorithms to solve problems.
- Introduce the maze activity and its goal: to navigate the robot from the start to the finish.

### **Step 1: Setting Up**

- Provide each student or group with a maze, a robot token, and command cards.
- Clearly show the starting position and the goal on the maze.

### **Step 2: Planning the Route**

- Ask students to analyze the maze and plan a route for the robot.
- Encourage them to use the command cards to create a sequence of instructions that will guide the robot through the maze.
- Have students lay out the sequence of commands in order.

### **Step 3: Executing the Plan**

- Students place their robot token at the starting position.
- They follow their planned sequence of commands to navigate the robot through the maze.
- If the robot encounters an obstacle or reaches a dead end, students should revise their plan and try again.

### **Extension: Blockly Maze Game**

- Once students successfully complete the maze activity, they can advance to a more challenging and interactive coding game using an iPad, such as the [Blockly Maze Game](https://blockly.games/maze?lang=en).

## **Reflection**

- After completing the maze activity, gather students into a group and discuss:
  - What challenges did you face?
  - How did you solve any problems that arose?
  - What strategies helped you find the correct path?
  - Discuss how this activity relates to real-world computational thinking and problem-solving.

## **Learning Outcomes**

- Develop computational thinking skills through planning and executing a sequence of steps.
- Enhance problem-solving abilities by identifying patterns and applying appropriate strategies.
