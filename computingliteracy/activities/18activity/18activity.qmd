## Description

Students will engage in an activity designed to introduce them to the fundamentals of electronics by making a simple circuit. The Play Doh conducts electricity and can be used to turn the LEDs on.

## Materials required

- Play Doh in a variety of colors
- LEDs in a variety of colors
- 5V Batteries with 5V Battery Holders (Alternative option is an Arduino with a laptop)
- Non-conductive Clay (optional)

## Steps to conduct the activity

1. Set up the station by organizing the materials
2. Explain to the students that batteries have both a positive (red) and negative (black) side and in order to turn anything on a circuit needs to connect these two sides using the lights and the play doh. A circuit is like a trail and the negative needs to be able to walk back to the battery through the postive.
3. Demonstrate the creation of a playdoh light system. Start by creating two blobs of playdough connect the red end of the battery to one and the black end to the other blob. Explain that the light has a long leg and a short leg. The short leg always has to be on the negative (black) side and the long leg always has to be towards the postive (red) side. Then connect the light to the blobs. Explain that the blobs can not touch out the electricity will skip past the light and not turn it on (this is called a short circuit). After connecting the light correctly the light should turn on. Explain if the light does not turn on when they try the first thing to test is to switch the direction of the legs (this is the most common mistake). 
4. Show the students it is possible to connect two lights by creating 3 blobs of playdoh and the outer blobs should be the postivie and negative ends connected to the play dough. Then use a light to connect the blobs with the long leg always facing the postive side. This is a series circuit.
6. Show the students it is possible to connect more than one light in the same section. Connect a second LED in the same direction as the one next to it. This is called a parallel circuit. 
5. Now give each of the students their materials to make their own. 

## Reflection

- Ask students what part of the actvity they found the hardest. Then ask if they found identifying question or creating them to be harder. 

## Learning Outcomes

As advancements in AI technology continue to grow, prompt engineering has emerged as a critical skill, with increasing demand in the job market. Introducing students to these concepts at an early age will enhance their understanding of how prompt engineering works and how it connects to their existing curriculum, fostering essential skills for the future of technology and innovation. Requiring students to formulate more specific and detailed questions will enhance their ability to identify and construct clear, precise prompts, an essential skill in prompt engineering. This practice not only deepens their understanding of the subject matter but also strengthens their critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, which are vital for success in the evolving field of AI and technology.
