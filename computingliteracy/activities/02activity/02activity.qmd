## Description

This activity is suitable for younger kids as it involves simpler tasks but can also be adjusted to be more challenging. It involves students mixing and matching a set of balloons with binary numbers (0 and 1) on them and decoding these sequences into decimal numbers. Additionally, it introduces students to how different binary sequences can represent different decimal numbers.

For students unfamiliar with the powers of 2, a reference sheet will be provided to guide them.

## Materials Required

- 3-4 Balloons
- Markers
- A sheet with the powers of 2
- Piece of paper and pens for calculations / Whiteboards and markers

## Steps to Conduct the Activity

### Step 1: Preparation

- Inflate 3 balloons and secure them. Blow up one more in case an additional example is needed.
- Write the binary digits 0 and 1 on the balloons using a permanent marker. Example provided in this folder: ![Example of binary balloon activity](../images/02activity.png).

### Step 2: Implementation

- Arrange the balloons in a line. You can use string or tape to ensure they stay in place.
- Prepare several different sequences for demonstration and practice (e.g., 000, 010, 011, 100, 110, 111).
- Have the extra balloon ready to be added to the activity so students can experiment with different examples.

### Step 3: Explanation

- Explain to the students that each balloon represents a binary digit (bit), and the position of the balloon determines its value in the binary number system.
- Explain that the index of the first balloon is always zero and increases from there.
- Explain the formula for decoding binary into decimal numbers.
- Provide examples of how binary is used in real life.

### Step 4: Implementation

- Divide students into different groups and ask them to solve the binary code.
- Mix up their balloons with those of another group.
- After solving, bring the groups together to compare their answers. If they got the same answer, discuss how they arrived at it.

## Reflection

Ask the following questions to stimulate discussion:

- What was the most challenging part of the activity?
- Did you find it easier to understand binary numbers after the activity? Why or why not?
- Can you think of other ways binary numbers might be used in the real world?

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should:

- Have a basic understanding of binary numbers and their positional value.
- Be able to convert simple binary numbers to decimal numbers.
- Develop problem-solving and teamwork skills through group activities.
