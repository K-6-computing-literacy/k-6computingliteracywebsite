## Description

This 30-minute activity introduces middle school students to Arduino by guiding them through the process of wiring a basic LED circuit using a breadboard and Arduino Uno—no programming required. Students will learn the fundamentals of electronics, including how to safely and effectively connect components.

## Materials Required

_Per student:_

- 1 Arduino Uno or equivalent  
- 1 Breadboard  
- 2 pieces of hookup wire (male-to-male)  
- 1 LED of any color  
- 1 470 ohm resistor (or close to it)  
- 1 10k ohm resistor (or greater)  
- 1 Arduino USB cable

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

- Identify parts of the Arduino Uno
- Understand how breadboards function
- Build a basic circuit to power an LED
- Demonstrate knowledge of polarity and resistance
- Troubleshoot common circuit connection issues

## Activity Steps

### 1. What is Arduino?

- Open-source electronics platform
- Uses programmable microcontrollers
- Controlled via USB and written in a C++-like language
- Great for prototyping

### 2. Parts of the Arduino UNO

- USB-B port (for programming)
- Digital pins (on/off signals)
- Analog pins (range of values, ideal for sensors)
- Power pins (5V, 3.3V, GND)

### 3. Breadboard Basics

- Blue (GND) and Red (PWR) buses connect vertically
- Rows connect horizontally, separated in the middle
- Easy for prototyping and modifying connections

### 4. LED Orientation

- Long leg = positive (connect to power)
- Short leg = negative (connect to ground)
- LED only lights in one direction

### 5. Resistor Function

- Limits electrical current
- 470Ω protects the LED
- 10kΩ dims the LED significantly
- Higher resistance = dimmer LED

### 6. Build Your First Circuit

**Step-by-step:**
1. Connect GND to blue bus on breadboard  
2. Connect 5V to red bus  
3. Insert 470Ω resistor from blue bus to row 10  
4. Place short leg of LED in row 10, long leg into red bus  
5. Plug in Arduino and power it up  
6. LED should light up!

## Questions to Ask

- Can you trace the flow of electricity from GND to 5V?
- What changes when you use the 10kΩ resistor instead of 470Ω?
- Do different colored LEDs vary in brightness?
- Can you add a second LED with the same color and parts? (Try 2 methods!)

## Reflection

- What did you find easy or hard about building the circuit?
- What would you change about how you built it?
- What else would you like to build with Arduino?
