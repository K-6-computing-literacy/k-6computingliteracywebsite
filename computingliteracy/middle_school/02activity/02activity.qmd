## Description

In this 30-minute session, students will explore coding with Arduino by building a circuit with 3 single-color LEDs and 1 RGB LED. They'll learn how to use digital and PWM pins to control light patterns and colors, and write basic Arduino sketches to make lights blink and fade.

## Materials Required

- 1 Arduino Uno or equivalent per student  
- 6 or more male-to-male hookup wires  
- 3 x 470 ohm resistors (or similar)  
- 3 LEDs of any color  
- 1 RGB LED

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the difference between digital and PWM pins on Arduino  
- Build a circuit using multiple LEDs and resistors  
- Use `digitalWrite()` to blink LEDs  
- Use `analogWrite()` to control an RGB LED's color  
- Debug common wiring/code errors  

## Agenda

### 1. Introduction to LED Control
- Review: What is an LED?  
- Polarity and how to wire an LED safely  
- Using resistors with LEDs

### 2. Blinking 3 LEDs
- Connect 3 single-color LEDs to pins 11, 12, and 13  
- Use `digitalWrite()` and `delay()`  
- Challenge: Create a pattern (e.g., traffic light or chase light)

### 3. RGB LED Basics
- Common Anode vs. Cathode RGB LEDs  
- Use PWM pins (9, 10, 11) for red, green, and blue  
- Create solid colors and mixes using `analogWrite()`  

### 4. Example Code Snippets


#### Lesson 1: Blink

```cpp
/*
  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:

*/

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
}

```

#### Lesson 2: Multiple Blinking Lights

```cpp
/*
  Blink 3 
*/

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(12, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(12, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);  
  digitalWrite(11, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(11, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);              
}
```

#### Lesson 3: RGB LED Mixing

```cpp
// Source https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-3-rgb-leds/arduino-sketch

void setup()
{
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT); // Red Pin
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT); // Green Pin
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);  // Blue Pin
}

void  loop() {
  setColor(255, 0, 0); // Red Color
  delay(1000);
  setColor(0,  255, 0); // Green Color
  delay(1000);
  setColor(0, 0, 255); // Blue Color
  delay(1000);
  setColor(255, 255, 255); // White Color
  delay(1000);
  setColor(170, 0, 255); // Purple Color
  delay(1000);
  setColor(127, 127,  127); // Light Blue
  delay(1000);
}

void setColor(int redValue, int greenValue,  int blueValue) {
  analogWrite(11, redValue);
  analogWrite(10,  greenValue);
  analogWrite(9, blueValue);
}
```

#### Lesson 4: Color Fade

```cpp
// Source https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/9ry4mg/fading_rgb_leds_through_the_color_spectrum/

int red = 11; 
int green = 10;
int blue = 9;
int t = 10; // Time for delay

void setup(){
    pinMode(red, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(green, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(blue, OUTPUT);
}
void Fade(){
  for( int i = 0; i <= 255; i++){
    analogWrite(red, i); // fade up 
    analogWrite(green, 255 - i); // fade down
    analogWrite(blue, 0); // do nothing
    delay(t);
  }
  for( int i = 0; i <= 255; i++){
    analogWrite(red, 255 - i); // fade down
    analogWrite(green, 0); // do nothing
    analogWrite(blue, i); // fade up 
    delay(t);
  }
    for( int i = 0; i <= 255; i++){
    analogWrite(red, 0); // do nothing
    analogWrite(green, i); // fade up
    analogWrite(blue, 255 - i); // fade down 
    delay(t);
  }
} 
void loop(){
Fade();
}

```
### 5. Extensions

- Use loops to fade between colors
- Add a button to change LED patterns
- Build a mini light show

## Reflection

- Which part of wiring the LEDs was most confusing?
- What would you try next with an RGB LED?
- How could this be applied in real-world projects?

## Questions to Ask
- Whatâ€™s the purpose of a resistor in your circuit?
- How could you make your circuit interactive?
- What happens if you remove the delay in your code?
